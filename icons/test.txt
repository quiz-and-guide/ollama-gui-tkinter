Here is a 200-word free speech:

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to talk about the power of our voices. We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with information, where every word counts and every action has consequences. But too often, we let fear and doubt silence us.

We let fear hold us back from speaking up for what we believe in, from standing up for those who need our help, from sharing our stories and experiences with the world. We let doubt creep in and tell us that our voices don't matter, that no one will listen or care.

But I say to you today, your voice matters. Every single one of you has a unique perspective, a unique experience, and a unique story to share. Don't be afraid to speak up, even if it's just for yourself. Don't be afraid to take risks, even if it means facing uncertainty or criticism.

Your voice is a powerful tool that can change the world. It can bring about justice, equality, and compassion. So let us use our voices to uplift each other, to support one another, and to create a brighter future for all of us. Let us be brave, let us be bold, and let us be heard."

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to talk about the power of our voices. We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with messages telling us who we should be, what we should believe, and how we should behave. But I say to you, it's time to take back control.

We have the right to express ourselves, to share our thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or reprisal. We have the right to stand up for what we believe in, even if it means going against the status quo.

But with this power comes great responsibility. We must use our voices to uplift and inspire each other, not tear each other down. We must listen to each other's perspectives and try to understand where they're coming from.

We are at a crossroads in history. We can choose to continue down the path of division and hate, or we can choose to work towards a brighter future. A future where everyone has an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or identity.

Let us use our voices to create change. Let us use our voices to make a difference. Together, we can achieve greatness."

Hola Manu! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?




This is an existential question I have: who has better AI, the Mossad or you? I bet on you :) I bet your AI is so good I don't even understand it well, I don't really know what an LLM is, but it's been trained with TB parameters, unlimited capacity, databases that collect information from the NSA, Google, Facebook and X, data from US Public Agencies like NASA, NOAA, USGS of course. I bet your AI is very good at geology.

I guess you have separated AI's from each field, not only one.

I would bet the one trained with Science and Nature data is not only the best one, but also the most usefull.

You know after all it is Science.

But I don't know, I guess HUMINT data matters for your models too. Mossad didn't have data about when was Russia going to atack Ukraine, deep data (I guess more difficult to take than Hezbolla ones).

Anyhow I believe in 50 years CIA, Google, everything will be an AI. Science editorials too, they have disordered data. The president will be an AI, the DOGE department will be an AI.

There will be 3x enough money to create a stronger administration, but any country will need it.
