However, if you're referring to the mathematical operation of exponentiation (i.e., 2^2), then yes, that would also be correct.\n\nIn general, when we multiply two numbers together, we are looking for the product or result of those numbers combined. In this case, 2 x 2 = 4 because 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4.\n\nHowever, if you're referring to exponentiation (i.e., 2^2), then yes, that would also be correct. The exponentiation operation raises a number to a power, in this case, 2 raised to the power of 2 equals 4."
