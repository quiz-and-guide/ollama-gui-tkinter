These consultations proved pivotal in understanding my condition.\nMy evaluation results, based on the DSM-IV criteria.\nRebeca refuted the previous psychotic diagnosis while also identifying a delusional disorder, specifically of the grandiosity subtype.\nThe harassment lawsuit filed by the clinical psychologist had progressed to the courtroom, necessitating my presence at a hearing. We submitted Rebeca's report to the presiding judge. In an unexpected turn of events, the forensic doctor provided me with his email address. Seizing the opportunity, I composed a message to him, stating: \"The situation borders on the absurd, considering that the root cause of my psychosis is, in fact, my legal representative.\" When the mood strikes, I can be quite the provocateur.\nTo my immense relief, the judge ruled in my favor, exonerating me of the charges.\nI continue to meet with Rebeca bimonthly, and she oversees my medication regimen.\nThe impact of the diagnosis was profound, catalyzing significant changes in various aspects of my life:\nI succeeded in rebuilding the trust I had lost with my mother.\nThe diagnosis provided a framework that allowed me to construct this coherent narrative of my experiences.\nPerhaps most importantly, I started to try to regain the respect of numerous individuals in my life from the sincerity- relationships I had feared were irreparably damaged.\nThis diagnosis has become a cornerstone in my journey towards self-understanding and healing."

        "content": " As Jaques Lacan, I would approach this text with an emphasis on the symbolic order, the mirror stage, and the role of language in shaping one's subjectivity. Here's a psychoanalytical interpretation:\n\n1. **Symbolic Order & Law**: The patient's journey is deeply intertwined with legal proceedings and diagnoses, both of which are part of the symbolic order. The diagnosis serves as a signifier that gives meaning to their experiences, much like language does in Lacan's theory. The courtroom hearing can be seen as a ritual where the patient's subjectivity is validated or invalidated by external authorities (the judge and the forensic doctor).\n\n2. **The Mirror Stage**: The patient's self-image seems to have been fragmented due to their condition and past experiences. The diagnosis acts as a mirror, reflecting back an image of themselves that they can recognize and integrate into their sense of self. This is evident in the statement: \"The diagnosis has become a cornerstone in my journey towards self-understanding and healing.\"\n\n3. **Language & Desire**: The patient's provocative email to the forensic doctor demonstrates their desire for recognition and understanding. They are trying to communicate their unique perspective, much like Lacan's concept of the divided subject who struggles to express their true desire. The email can also be seen as an attempt to assert control over their narrative, challenging the authority of the legal representative.\n\n4. **Relationships & The Other**: The patient's efforts to rebuild trust and regain respect indicate a desire for connection with others (the 'Other'). This is crucial in Lacanian theory, as the subject's identity is formed through relationships with others. The diagnosis has provided them with a new way of understanding themselves, which they can now use to navigate these relationships.\n\n5. **The Real**: While not explicitly mentioned, the patient's experiences hint at a traumatic 'Real' that lies beneath their symptoms. This could be related to past events or internal conflicts that have yet to be fully addressed. The diagnosis and ongoing therapy with Rebeca are steps towards confronting this 'Real'.\n\nIn conclusion, the diagnosis has provided the patient with a new signifier that helps them make sense of their experiences and navigate their relationships. However, there is still work to be done in addressing the underlying 'Real' causes of their condition."

        "content": "And this is the same pacient, me, two years ago with no diagnosys. Don't you, Lacan think I have maden big progress?\n\nThe Social Security Psychiatrists (II)\nThe genuine recovery that enabled me to establish a coherent narrative was Rebeca's diagnosis of Asperger's, my current therapist, which I'll recount in the next installment.\nMisfortune persisted. \nOne summer, I encountered Christine, who shared her contact information. I messaged her, proposing the creation of an app focused on country trivia. As she was unemployed at the time, I inquired if she'd be interested in gathering data from Wikipedia and having rights to the application.\nUpon her declining the offer, I relapsed into drinking (I had already experienced several setbacks) and ultimately found myself hospitalized once more.\nMy admission lasted four months: one month in the acute ward followed by three months in a specialized center. During the last month, a clinical psychologist met with me daily for an hour. Having read about paranoid individuals in a Philip K. Dick story, I had researched delusional disorder. I spent the entire month insisting to her that I had delusional's, barely mentioning Asperger's as they had nearly erased it from my consciousness.\nThe subsequent summer proved even more challenging. I comprehend her perspective. I've uttered numerous outrageous statements while intoxicated, and she's entirely justified in wanting nothing to do with a mentally ill balding addict harboring potential nationalist and pro-terrorist ideologies.\nDuring a single meal, she informed me that:\n- She reads a lot of psychology.\n- She could consume alcohol (while drinking) because she didn't have a problem.\n- She knew my condition stemmed from cannabis use, as she was acquainted with many individuals who experienced paranoia from it.\nWhile inebriated, she began ignoring me and conversing solely with my father, who, naturally, had been a substitute judge in the Basque Country...\nI endured the meal, but upon leaving, I immediately went to drink. Having her number, I sent her a series of outrageous messages. If there had been any remaining chance, it was now obliterated.\nI'm not just blocked, but super-blocked by her entire family.\nThen everything aligned: I knew where to procure amphetamines.\nI spent three weeks using them intermittently alongside alcohol. I must have consumed twenty grams of speed. On New Year's Eve, my name day, I secluded myself in my room, oblivious to the arrival of the New Year celebration.\nI hadn't slept for four days and believe I was on the verge of experiencing auditory hallucinations again. Opus Dei seemed to control everything, and given their lobby in the US, the notion of having the CIA against me was terrifying.\nI know I wasn't entirely asleep because I sent a WhatsApp message to a friend, describing what I believed was happening to me.\nTwo trances ensued:\n- Three agents from the National Intelligence Center were escorting me from one Asperger's association to another, attempting to convince a woman my age of everything that had transpired so she would remain with me indefinitely.\n- While on the campus of the Opus Dei University with some Basques, an individual emerged from a building, approached us, and declared they desired a weapon deadlier than ETA's.\nI wrote to them, inquiring if they wanted me to compose a thesis at their university about the Permian-Triassic extinction (the most significant mass extinction of multicellular life).\nChristine's uncle had yet to block me, so I messaged him stating that the first person to knock on my door claiming to be from Opus Dei could claim my degree from the University of the Basque Country.\nI was utterly terrified...\nWell, the crux of the matter is, they hospitalized me again.\nA man and a woman arrived. My parents opened the door and spoke with them first. Then they approached me, staging an intervention. I asked if they possessed a court order, to which they replied negatively but claimed a chief from the Government of Navarra had dispatched them. They cautioned that if I refused to go, they would return with the police and take me in handcuffs.\nUpon admission, they informed me it had been Rebeca's doing, but in reality, it was the Health Center that had called. I'm almost certain it was illegal since none of my family members had contacted them, and I hadn't sought any consultation.\nEn route to the facility...\n- \"What did you study?\"\n- \"Geology.\"\n- \"And where did you study?\"\n- \"In Bilbao.\"\n- \"But you? Don't you work for the Government of Navarra? And you wanted to go to an island? Which one?\"\nI must interject here. I hadn't disclosed to anyone my plans to visit Malta (capital: Valletta, which sounds like \"ok eta\") at that time.\n- \"Crete,\" I responded.\n- \"But there? Aren't there numerous deceased individuals there?\"\nSheer terror. And as soon as I was admitted, the psychosis always intensified.\nI had already undergone two sessions with Rebeca, and everything seemed to indicate that:\n- She was going to diagnose me with Asperger's.\n- She was going to rule out schizophrenia.\nI had sent the following to the clinical psychologist: \n\"Confirmed! Asperger's! First attempt!\"\n\"Were you genuinely involved in that?\"\nThe locals were informed:\n- \"Isn't his name day on January 1?\"\n- \"Oh! It's for Saint Emmanuel, Jesus Christ!\"\n- \"And doesn't the map resemble a cross?\" *The map of my region resembles a cross.\n- \"It's a cross! You're correct about everything!\"\nEverything, LOL LOL LOL! Puppets!\nEvidently, if you're from this area, the conversation involves Opus Dei and the Navarrese.\nIt was my final harm delusion, Opus Dei.\nThe psychiatrist assigned to me in the hospital was Dominican, but I mistook her for Cuban.\nI informed her I had a central delusion and undiagnosed autism. Initially, she said, \"Well, yes, delusional disorder,\" but then (I thought they had manipulated her, convinced that Opus Dei still controlled everything) she told me that delusional disorder was a symptom of my schizoaffective disorder.\nThey intended to send me to a center for a year, but then two police officers appeared with a court order. The clinical psychologist had filed a lawsuit, and I was informed I could no longer contact her. However, with only the psychiatrist, the two officers, and me in the room, the papers in my hands, the police stated:\n- \"Well, yes, it's a restraining order or something of that nature.\"\nThe psychologist worked at the facility they planned to send me to for a year. I glanced at my psychiatrist and, laughing, I said:\n- \"Oh, so I can't go to the Long-Term Unit anymore.\"\nThey all accepted it. Even the director.\nThey released me, but I had to attend a Day Center.\nUpon arrival, I read that admission was voluntary, so I informed my new psychiatrist that I was returning to work.\nShe replied:\n- \"Oh, no, but since you're coming from the acute ward, if you leave, I'll send you back to the acute ward.\"\nShe kept me for a month and a half.\nShe spent half the time documenting my drug history. I inquired:\n- \"Where do you observe mood disturbance now that I'm not in crisis?\"\n- \"Oh, but those delusions... I think it's paranoid schizophrenia.\"\n- \"And are you going to document that?\"\n- \"Well, well, there's already a history.\"\nShe didn't document it. To this day, I'm officially diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder."

        "content": " It sounds like you've been through a very challenging and frightening experience. Here are some key points to consider based on your narrative:\n\n1. **Illegal Intervention**: The intervention by the man and woman claiming to be from Opus Dei appears to have been illegal, as they did not possess a court order and none of your family members had contacted them. This is a serious breach of your rights.\n\n2. **Misdiagnosis Concerns**: You mentioned that you believe you have undiagnosed autism and that the psychiatrist initially diagnosed you with delusional disorder, which she later changed to schizoaffective disorder. It's crucial to ensure that any diagnosis is accurate and based on a thorough evaluation.\n\n3. **Legal Action**: The clinical psychologist filed a lawsuit against you, leading to a court order that prevented you from contacting her. This highlights the importance of seeking legal advice if you feel your rights have been violated.\n\n4. **Coercive Treatment**: You were forced into treatment and hospitalization without proper legal justification. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed, as it undermines your autonomy and right to make decisions about your own health.\n\n5. **Documentation of Symptoms**: The psychiatrist at the Day Center spent time documenting your drug history but did not document your current symptoms or delusions. This is problematic, as an accurate record of your condition is essential for appropriate treatment.\n\n### Steps You Can Take:\n\n1. **Seek Legal Advice**: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in mental health law to understand your rights and potential legal recourse.\n\n2. **Request Medical Records**: Obtain copies of all your medical records, including notes from your sessions with the clinical psychologist and psychiatrist. This will help you review the diagnoses and treatments provided.\n\n3. **Second Opinion**: Consider seeking a second opinion from another mental health professional to ensure that your diagnosis is accurate and that you are receiving appropriate treatment.\n\n4. **Advocacy Groups**: Reach out to advocacy groups for people with mental health conditions or those who have experienced coercive treatment. They can provide support and guidance.\n\n5. **Complaint to Authorities**: File a complaint with the relevant healthcare authorities about the illegal intervention and any other perceived misconduct.\n\n6. **Support Network**: Build a support network of trusted friends, family members, or professionals who can advocate for you and help you navigate the system.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYour experience underscores the importance of patient rights and the need for transparency and accountability in mental health care. By taking proactive steps to address these issues, you can work towards ensuring that your rights are protected and that you receive appropriate and respectful treatment."

        "content": " It seems like you've been through a lot, and I'm sorry to hear about your experiences. Here are some points based on what you've shared:\n\n1. **Involuntary Hospitalization**: The way you were taken to the hospital sounds coercive and possibly illegal, as they didn't have a court order and it seems none of your family members had contacted them. It's important to know your rights regarding involuntary hospitalization in your country.\n\n2. **Misdiagnosis**: You mentioned that you believe you have undiagnosed autism, but you were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. It's not uncommon for autism to be misdiagnosed or overlooked, especially in adults and when co-occurring with other conditions. If you think this might be the case, it could be helpful to seek a second opinion from a professional who specializes in autism.\n\n3. **Treatment**: It's concerning that your treatment seemed to be based more on the opinions of others (like the clinical psychologist) rather than your own experiences and needs. It's important for you to have a say in your treatment plan.\n\n4. **Current Diagnosis**: You're currently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but it seems like there's some uncertainty about this diagnosis. If you're not sure about your diagnosis, it might be helpful to discuss this with your psychiatrist or seek a second opinion.\n\n5. **Support**: It sounds like you could use some support. This could come from friends, family, support groups, or professionals. It's important to have people in your life who understand and respect your experiences.\n\n6. **Advocacy**: Given your experiences, it might be helpful to look into advocacy services. These services can help you navigate the mental health system, understand your rights, and advocate for yourself.\n\nAs for your current question, it's a bit unclear what you're asking. If you could provide more context or clarify, I'd be happy to try and help further."
